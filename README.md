Welcome to **MR.VELOUS**! This hobby project is all about exploring medical images with style and a smile.

## ü§î What's in the Name?

**MR.VELOUS** stands for **"MR Viewer with Enhanced Layout and Optimised User Satisfaction."** The name is a play on the word "marvelous," reflecting the goal of creating a viewer that‚Äôs not just functional but also a joy to use.

## üß© What's Inside?

- **NIfTI Image Support**: Open and explore medical images in the NIfTI format. (More formats are on the way!)
- **Enhanced Layout**: Designed to be easy to use and pleasant to look at. Why settle for dull when it can be delightful?
- **Active Development**: This app is a work in progress, with new features and improvements added regularly. The aim is to make this the best online viewer out there.

**MR.VELOUS** is a passion project, and working on it is an absolute blast. Feedback and suggestions are the sprinkles on the ice cream üç¶, so feel free to share your thoughts!
