Welcome to **MR.VELOUS**! This passion project is dedicated to exploring medical images with both style and ease. One of the main goals is to tap into the potential of **Svelte 5**, leveraging its cutting-edge features to craft cleaner, more efficient code and deliver a seamless user experience.

## ü§î What's in the Name?

**MR.VELOUS** stands for **"MR Viewer with Enhanced Layout and Optimized User Satisfaction."** The name playfully nods to "marvelous," capturing the spirit of creating a viewer that‚Äôs not only functional but also enjoyable to use.
